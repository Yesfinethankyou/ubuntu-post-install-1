Installing Debian package archives (DEBs). Installing Python packages. Upgrading system packages. Purging unwanted packages. Please do have a look at exceptions, as all tasks cannot be simulated. This option will simulate installing packages mentioned in the config, using the apt-get's dry-run option. This option can be used to check if the configuration and for testing. Installation of DEB files also behaves in a similar way. It uses dpkg -i --dry-run to simulate installation. Its a very good idea to simulate installation when you have reconfigured the apps and packages in the config to check what might be error prone. DEB package files and binaries will be downloaded unlike apt-get package installs. Exceptions - Not everything can be simulated Simulate flag will not simulate adding Repositories or PPAs. If you want to revert the changes please use Reset Repositories option. PPAs and repositories will be added regardless of the flag. Python package installation cannot be simulated. (pip lacks support for it) The script will skip installing apt dependencies and python packages, if simulate option is used. APT package upgrades and apt repository metadata updates cannot be simulated. Skip Version Checks \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects --skip-version-check Script will warn you and exit if you are not running latest version of the script. You can skip that by using the above option. Fix for latest Ubuntu releases \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects -f OR ./after-effects --fix This flag/option applies to following repositories Google Cloud SDK GCSFUSE InSync Docker Community Edition Wine HQ Usually it takes a while for additional repositories (Docker,etc) to add support for latest release of Ubuntu. However we can use the previous release for which packages might be available. Using packages built for previous release works fine most of the time. Repositories like Spotify and Google Chrome do not use code names in their repository URLs. So the above workaround is not necessary. Derivatives of Ubuntu will use the code name of Ubuntu on which they are based. For example Linux mint 18.2 Serena will use code name xenial as it is based on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus This option applies only for the latest release and will be ignored if the release is not latest. Fix fallback to LTS \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects --fix-mode-lts Use LTS as fallback. This flag should be used in conjunction with --fix Otherwise it will be ignored. Instead of using previous Ubuntu release this will use the last LTS release. i.e if you are on disco and use this bionic repositories will be used. Please use this with caution as it may not work. Note for Pre-Release/ development version of Ubuntu/Debian If you are using a pre-release version of Ubuntu, you can use --pre-release flag to apply the above mentioned fix to pre-release version of Ubuntu. This flag can be used independent of --fix . If both are used together then both flags will be applied if the release is upcoming-release. If the release is stable, only --fix flag will be valid and --pre-release is ignored. Purge not required packages \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects -d OR ./after-effects --purge Usually Ubuntu comes with some pre-installed games, packages which you might not need. This option is a switch to used in purging these packages mentioned in the subsequent sections. Since it is possible that user might purge necessary packages like sudo or other core system components, these just acts like a barrier from accidentally doing so. Warning This flag MUST be passed, if you intend to purge packages from system. Otherwise you will receive an error. If you are using YML config file you MUST set purge_enabled: true under config.flags. See Example YAML file for more info. Delete log file \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects -l OR ./after-effects --delete-log Just a quick way to delete logs generated by this script. Flag priority If you pass -l rest of the commands will be ignored, as the script exits after deleting the log! Keep downloaded DEB files \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects -k OR ./after-effects --keep-debs Keeps packages cached by APT and downloaded DEB packages. Default behavior is to clean apt cache and delete downloaded DEB packages. Remote YAML configuration file \u00b6 Usage ./after-effects --remote-yaml <URL to YAML file> OR ./after-effects -R <URL to YAML file> You can specify YAML file to use. Script will fetch it and parse it.The file should be available without any interactive logins. Warning If using GitHub gists, you MUST use raw gist URL. You should only use trusted remote locations to save your configurations and only use trusted configurations. Version \u00b6 Usage ./after-effect -v OR ./after-effects --version This will display version info. You do not have to be root to run this.

It might take some time till the repositories are available for the latest release. Use -f or --fix command line option or --pre-release in case you are using a development version of Ubuntu to revert using latest available version of repositories (usually previous Ubuntu release or in case of Beta/Alpha latest stable release of Ubuntu). For more info see command line options. Controlling which repository is added using config file You can set your YML file to decide which repository is added. Some repositories may no be supported on your architecture or distribution. Take a look at config.yml for example. If you omit a value, it defaults to false ALWAYS . Do note that if you are using lists default values are different, they are mentioned in below. ROS Releases & Ubuntu/Debian versions ROS repository only support certain Ubuntu/Debian distributions. You can find more info at ROS-Wiki Though Ubuntu derivatives might work, they are not supported. Example yaml configuration snippet is given below. config: # Enabled Tasks tasks: update: true # Add Repos # individual repos flags are mentioned under config.add_repo key repo: true # Repository Flags add_repo: winehq: true docker: true mendeley: false googlecloud: true spotify: true vscode: true skype: true signal: false insync: true github: true google: true Canonical partner repositories \u00b6 Canonical partner repositories are not configured or enabled for derivatives of Ubuntu because thee might be some conflicts. Add personal package archives (PPA) \u00b6 Only one ppa entry per line (No comments or anything else anywhere in the file) in the format ppa:{author}/{ppa} for example ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next The file will be read and the PPAs will be added from the list. Logs will show entry in the format [date and time] [ PPA-Logs ] <log> Warning PPAs are not supported on Debian. Install apt packages \u00b6 There are seven list of packages under key config.install.apt.[mentioned from 1-7] administration - Contains Administrative packages security - Contains Security related tools and packages productivity - Office tools, writing tools, LateX, document tools and other productivity tools, Email clients, browsers, IM clients etc. multimedia - Multimedia tools like media players, audio converters and playes etc. development - IDEs [Spyder, Jetbeans etc], languages [go, python, ruby, rust, java etc], Containers [docker lxc rkt etc], Python libraries, compilers [gcc, clang] SDKs [AWS SDK, Google Cloud SDK, open-jdk, Tensor Flow], headers and libraries[ocl-icd-dev], Anything related to development and -dev or -devl packages. other - Everything which does not fit in the above categories. Themes, Tools, Utilities etc. external - Any packages which are provided by ppas, or repositories not present in base Ubuntu distribution. There's a possibility that the repository might not be added or may be unavailable or offline. So Keeping the list separate from others packages minimizes errors if there are any. This classification is only for ease of use and need not be strictly followed. You can put 'vlc' package in 'security', it will still install fine. This classification helps while writing configs and editing them. Its advised to follow it if your configs tend to get to couple of hundreds of lines. Also YAML file should be a valid YAML & indented by 2 spaces. Special list of packages - Purge list \u00b6 There is a special package list under key, config.purge list of apt packages to be purged from the system. Install Debian package archives (.deb files) \u00b6 This will install deb files specified in the YAML config under config.install.debian_packages . Each DEB file to be installed should have following entry. URL to the deb file which can be accessed using wget , Name of the deb file without any spaces or special chars except hyphen. For example to install Atom Editor the entry should look like below. config : install : debian_packages : - https://atom-installer.github.com/v1.21.1/atom-amd64.deb,ATOM-Editor.deb First part is the URL to the deb file separated by ',' name of the file. Note on file name in configuration Please note that deb file will be saved with the name mentioned in the file. (DEB file is named exactly as mentioned in the second field. So if you want them to be named with extension .deb include that in the second field and avoid illegal chars) Install Static binaries to /usr/local/bin \u00b6 This will install binaries bin.list or YAML config under config.install.binaries . Simulate option will download the package but not install it. Configuration is similar to deb files mentioned above. First part is the URL to the binary file followed by ',' and name of the binary. For example, to install docker-compose , the entry should look like below. config : install : binaries : - https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64,docker-compose Note on file names in configuration Please note that file will be saved with the name mentioned in the file and will be in your path. Install python packages (via pip) \u00b6 This will install system wide python packages using pip. You can specify in YAML config under config.install.python2 or config.install.python3 - These follow similar configuration as packages files. One item per line. however you can specify version requirements as you would for requirements file. - Simulate flag will skip installing packages, unless --internal-ci-mode is used. Example configuration is given below. config : install : python2 : - docker-compose python3 : - awscli Warning Some recent distributions do not support Python2. Purge Unwanted Packages \u00b6 This will purge Unwanted packages from the system. The packages mentioned in config.purge in yaml. The format of the purge.list is similar to that of packages, one package per line Warning It is necessary to pass command line argument -d or set config.flags.purge_enabled: true in config. Reset repositories / Purge PPAs \u00b6 This will reset the repositories, and purge ppas added by this script. This will NOT reset or remove repositories added by the DEB files. Simulate option has no effect on this action and ppa-purge WILL downgrade packages if necessary. Scope of this function This will NOT remove PPAs or repositories you have added manually or those added while installing DEB files. Additionally, this will not un-install packages installed from those repos and PPAs. Installing Snap packages \u00b6 Script can install snap packages from snapstore. For example check the default config file.
